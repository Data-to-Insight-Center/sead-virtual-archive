User interface business objects and object model.

<h2>Summary</h2>

    by the {@link org.dataconservancy.ui.dao DAO layer}, business processes are executed by the {@link
    org.dataconservancy.ui.services services layer}, and the controller and view layers are handled by {@link
    org.dataconservancy.ui.stripes Stripes action beans}.
