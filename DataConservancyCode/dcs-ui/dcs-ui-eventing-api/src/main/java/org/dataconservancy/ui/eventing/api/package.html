Eventing API for the Data Conservancy Reference UI.

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>
    The Eventing API is based on a publish-subscribe model, where {@link org.dataconservancy.ui.eventing.api.Event}s are
    published to the {@link org.dataconservancy.ui.eventing.api.EventManager}, and classes subscribe to {@code events}
    by registering {@link org.dataconservancy.ui.eventing.api.EventListener}s with the {@code EventManager}.
</p>

<h3>Event Properties</h3>

<p>
    {@code Events} have four properties, which can be leveraged by {@code EventManagers} to filter events seen by
    {@code EventListeners}, and used by {@code EventListeners} to act on the event appropriately.
</p>

<h4>Event Class</h4>

<p>
    Not to be confused with their Java Class, the Event Class represents one of two categories of events: <em>audit</em>
    and <em>exception</em> events.  Audit events are meant to indicate that something happened in the system which
    should be noted.  A user login, a file download, a user registration are all examples of audit events.  Exception
    events are meant to indicate that something exceptional has happened, and the system should respond appropriately.
    For example, the system has been requested to be shutdown, or a {@code java.lang.Exception} has been thrown.
</p>

<h4>Event Context</h4>

<p>
    The {@code EventContext} captures what the system was doing at the time the {@code Event} was constructed.  It
    supplies information that would be useful for human interpretation of the {@code event}.
</p>

<h4>Event Object</h4>
    This is often the object which triggered the {@code Event}; it represents the result of the system process that
    produced the {@code event}.  For example, if a {@code NewUserRegistration} event is received, the object of the
    event would be an instance of the {@code Person} that registered.  If a {@code ExceptionEvent} is received, the
    object of the event would be the {@code Exception} that triggered the vent.
<p>

</p>

<h4>Event Topic</h4>
    Event topics are meant to be analogus to JMS topics.  See the
    <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/6/tutorial/doc/bncdx.html">JMS Tutorial</a> for more information on topics.
