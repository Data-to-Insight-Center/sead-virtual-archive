Provides abstractions for Data Conservancy Package (DCP) profiles.

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>
    The Data Conservancy Package data model is very flexible, and can be applied in many different ways.  This is
    problematic when an agent attempts to interpret the contents of a DCP that it did not create.  Profiles can be
    used to improve the portability of DCPs.  If an agent determines which profile(s) a DCP conforms to, it will
    be able to interpret the contents of the DCP appropriately, even if the agent did not create the DCP.  (This assumes
    that the profiles are shared between the agents.)
</p>

<p>
    There are two primary abstractions in this package: {@link org.dataconservancy.ui.profile.Profile} and
    {@link org.dataconservancy.ui.profile.Profiler}.  The {@code Profile} abstraction exposes key properties of a DCP
    profile (importantly the profile type and version).  Together, the type and version of a {@code Profile} should be
    unique.  The {@code Profiler} abstracts the business logic used to interpret the DCP.  It is responsible for
    determining if a candidate DCP conforms to the {@code Profile}, enumerating the business objects in a conforming
    DCP, and retrieving identified business objects of a conforming DCP.  Because the identity of the profile (that is,
    an instance of {@code Profile}) is necessarily coupled with its interpretation, the {@code Profiler} is accessible
    from the {@code Profile}.
