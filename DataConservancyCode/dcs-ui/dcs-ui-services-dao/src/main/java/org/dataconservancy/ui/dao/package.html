Used to persist, search, and retrieve business objects from an underlying store.

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>
    Data Access Objects defined interfaces for creating, updating, and accessing business objects in some data store.
    Multiple implementations may exist for a DAO; there may be an in-memory implementation useful for development and
    testing, and a persistable implementation (usually based on JDBC) whose data survives application restarts.
    Understand, however, that even JDBC-based DAOs may point to an in-memory database, whose contents are lost upon
    application restart.
</p>
<p>
    Generally speaking, DAOs should not be invoked directly by the developer.  The {@link org.dataconservancy.ui.services
    service layer} uses DAOs to provide higher-order functionality; the service layer is the developer's entrance point
    for invoking business logic.
</p>
<p>
    <em>DAOs should not be assumed to be thread-safe.</em>  The service layer is responsible for providing
    synchronization and thread-safety.
