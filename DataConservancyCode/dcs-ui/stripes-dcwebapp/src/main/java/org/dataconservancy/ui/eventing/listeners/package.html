Event Listeners used by the Reference UI.

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>
    The system comes with three event listeners: one which logs events that are received, another which notifies
    administrators via email that an exception has occurred, and a listener which notifies administrators that
    a user has registered for access to the system.
