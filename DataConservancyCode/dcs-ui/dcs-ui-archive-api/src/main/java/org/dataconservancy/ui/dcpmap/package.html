Maps business objects to Data Conservancy Packages.

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>
    Business objects of archival significance are archived in an instance of the Data Conservancy.  These business
    objects are serialized as Data Conservancy Packages (DCP) prior to deposit into the Data Conservancy.  Classes
    in this package map user interface business objects to the DCP model and back.
