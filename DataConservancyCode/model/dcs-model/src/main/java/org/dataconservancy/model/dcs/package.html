The Data Conservancy Java object model.
<p>
For more information on the Data Conservancy data model, please see the <a href="https://wiki.library.jhu.edu/x/ooCo">SIP specification</a> of the
data model and other <a href="https://wiki.library.jhu.edu/x/jgWi">related</a> wiki pages.
</p>
<h2>Implementation Notes</h2>
<p>
The goal of the object model design is to prevent accidental mutation of the objects in the model.  Any time an
object is returned by an accessor method (whether that object is a <code>Collection</code> or a DCS model object), it
will have been defensively copied.  Mutating the returned object will not mutate the original object.  Likewise, when
an object is passed to an accessor method, it will be defensively copied before it is assigned as a member of the model
object.  This may change in the future, because defensively copying objects impacts performance, especially as it
pertains to memory use.  You can add elements to the model by calling the appropriate <code>set...</code> or <code>add...</code>
methods, but you cannot remove elements from the model.
</p>
<p>
The initial state of Strings are <code>null</code> and the initial state of Collections will be empty.  Code that interrogates
model should be prepared to handle <code>null</code> values.  Even if the model has been validated (e.g. a validator
may check to ensure that all 'ref' attributes have non-null values), optional elements of the model that are in their
default state will return <code>null</code>.    

In general, passing <code>null</code> references to accessor methods will result in <code>java.lang.IllegalArgumentException</code>
being thrown.  Exceptions to this are <code>setParent(...)</code> methods, which use a <code>null</code> value to indicate
there is no parent.
