Access UI is a GWT app running entirely on the client web browser.

The access service url can be set by editing src/main/resources/org/dataconservancy/dcs/access/ui/public/Config.properties before compilation or app/Config.properties in the deployed war. Additionally the default can be overridden by passing a parameter 'accessurl' to the web application.

A test access service can be started from the dcs-access connector by running:
mvn generate-test-resources process-test-resources org.dataconservancy.access:dcs-access-maven-plugin:seed-archive org.dataconservancy.access:dcs-access-maven-plugin:seed-index jetty:run
